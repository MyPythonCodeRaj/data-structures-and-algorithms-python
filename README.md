## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MyPythonCodeRaj/data-structures-and-algorithms-python.git
   cd data-structures-and-algorithms-python
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):

   - For testing, you can use `unittest` or `pytest` to run the test cases.

   ```bash
   pip install pytest  # Optional: If you're using pytest for unit testing
   ```

3. **Run the code**:
   Navigate to the folder of the data structure/algorithm you want to learn and run the respective Python file.

   ```bash
   python data_structures/arrays/array_implementation.py
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
  Run the test suite using `unittest`:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/unit_tests/
   ```
